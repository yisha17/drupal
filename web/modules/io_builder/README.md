INTRODUCTION
------------
The main focus of the module was editing/adding paragraphs on nodes in the frontend. But the IO builder can be used for all fieldable entity types (media, taxonomy termsâ€¦)

It provides an out of the box integration with paragraphs and other entities, so that site builders can enable the modules required, configure their entities and start using the IO builder.

- Drupal >= 8.8
